Predicting stock market trends using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) involves several steps. Here's a general outline of the process:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Gather historical stock price data (e.g., open, high, low, close, volume).
   - Collect any other relevant financial indicators or features that may help in prediction (e.g., moving averages, RSI, MACD).

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Normalize or standardize the data to ensure all features have similar scales.
   - Create labels for uptrend or downtrend based on future price movements.
   - Split the data into training, validation, and testing sets.

3. **Feature Selection**:
   - Select features that are most relevant to predicting trends.

4. **Building the ANN Model**:
   - Define the architecture of the neural network (e.g., number of layers, number of neurons per layer, activation functions).
   - Compile the model with a suitable loss function and optimizer.

5. **Training the Model**:
   - Train the ANN on the training dataset.
   - Use the validation set to tune hyperparameters and avoid overfitting.

6. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set.
   - Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to assess the performance.

7. **Prediction**:
   - Use the trained model to predict future trends.

Hereâ€™s a sample implementation using Python with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Keras (a high-level neural network API, running on top of TensorFlow).

### Sample Implementation:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Dropout
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('path_to_your_data.csv')

# Preprocess data
data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Date'])
data.set_index('Date', inplace=True)

# Generate technical indicators or additional features if needed
data['Moving_Avg_10'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=10).mean()
data['RSI'] = compute_rsi(data['Close'])

# Remove any NaN values created by rolling or other operations
data.dropna(inplace=True)

# Define target variable - uptrend (1) or downtrend (0)
data['Target'] = np.where(data['Close'].shift(-1) > data['Close'], 1, 0)

# Select features and target
features = ['Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', 'Volume', 'Moving_Avg_10', 'RSI']
X = data[features].values
y = data['Target'].values

# Normalize the features
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Build the ANN model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(64, input_dim=X_train.shape[1], activation='relu'))
model.add(Dropout(0.2))
model.add(Dense(32, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dropout(0.2))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer=Adam(lr=0.001), loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)

# Evaluate the model
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f'Test Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}')

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
predicted_classes = np.where(predictions > 0.5, 1, 0)

# Assess performance
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix

print(confusion_matrix(y_test, predicted_classes))
print(classification_report(y_test, predicted_classes))
```

### Important Considerations:
- **Feature Engineering**: Additional features and technical indicators often improve model performance.
- **Data Quality**: Ensure data is clean and correctly labeled.
- **Model Complexity**: Avoid overfitting by tuning the model and using techniques like dropout.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Choose metrics that suit the problem, such as precision and recall for imbalanced datasets.

This is a simplified example and might require adjustments based on specific datasets and requirements.
